# Dashboard

DebiAI has a Graphical User Interface that allows you to navigate through your projects, select selections, select models and start an analysis.

## Starting an analysis

The analylis dashboard is the central part of DebiAI. It is where you will be able to place widgets and explore your data and model results. Each available widget description is available in the [widget documentation](./widgets/README.md).

To start an analysis, you first need to select a project from the project list. Then, if you have some in your project, you can select one or multiple selections or models. If you have not created any selection or model yet, refer to the [Python module documentation](../dataInsertion/pythonModule/quickStart.md) or to the [Web data-provider documentation](../dataInsertion/dataProviders/quickStart.md).

## Analysis dashboard

Once you have selected a project and a selection or a model, you can start an analysis by clicking on the "Start analysis" button. This will open the analysis dashboard where you can place widgets and explore your data and model results. Each available widget description is available in the [widget documentation](./widgets/README.md).

### Dashboard features:

- [Exporting data](./dataExport/). You can export your data to other tools for annotation or further analysis purposes.

- [Configuring widgets](./widgetConfigSave/). You can save some of the widget configuration to be able to load it later. 

- [Saving a layout](./layouts/). You can save your current layout to be able to load it later. This allows you to save a layout that you like and return to it later.
