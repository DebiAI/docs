# Dashboard

DebiAI has a Graphical User Interface that allows you to navigate through your projects, select selections, select models and start an analysis.

## Starting an analysis

The analysis dashboard is the central part of DebiAI. It is where you will be able to place widgets and explore your data and model results.

To start an analysis, you first need to select a project from the project list, you can then click on "Analyse" to load the project data and reach the analysis dashboard. If you have any selections or any model resluts in your project, you can select one or more before starting an analysis, this will only load the data that is in the selection or the model results.

If you have not yet created any projects, selections or models, refer to the [Python module](../dataInsertion/pythonModule/quickStart.md) or to the [Data providers](../dataInsertion/dataProviders/quickStart.md) guides.

## Analysis dashboard

Once you have started an analysis and the data is loaded, you will be able to see the analysis dashboard where you can place widgets and explore your data and model results. To learn more about the available widgets, refer to the [widget documentation](./widgets/README.md).

### Dashboard features:

Besides the widgets, the dashboard has several features that allow you to interact with the data and the dashboard itself:

- [Configuring widgets](./widgetConfigSave/). You can save some of the widget configuration to be able to load it later.

- [Saving a layout](./layouts/). You can save your current dashboard layout to be able to load it later.

- [Custom algorithms](./customAlgorithms/). You can create your own algorithms and use them with the data in the dashboard.

- [Exporting data](./dataExport/). You can export your data to other tools for annotation or further analysis purposes.
