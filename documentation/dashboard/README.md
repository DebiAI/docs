# Dashboard

DebiAI has a Graphical User Interface that allows you to navigate through your projects, select selections, select models and start an analysis.

## Starting an analysis

The analylis dashboard is the central part of DebiAI. It is where you will be able to place widgets and explore your data and model results. Each available widget description is available in the [widget documentation](./widgets/README.md).

To start an analysis, you first need to select a project from the project list. Then, if you have some in your project, you can select one or multiple selections or models. If you have not created any selection or model yet, refer to the [Python module documentation](../dataInsertion/pythonModule/quickStart.md) or to the [Web data-provider documentation](../dataInsertion/dataProviders/quickStart.md).

## Analysis dashboard

Once you have selected a project and a selection or a model, you can start an analysis by clicking on the "Start analysis" button. This will open the analysis dashboard where you can place widgets and explore your data and model results. Each available widget description is available in the [widget documentation](./widgets/README.md).

## Exporting data

During an analysis, you can export your data to other tools for annotation or further analysis purposes. To learn more about how to export data, refer to the [data export documentation](./dataExport/README.md).
