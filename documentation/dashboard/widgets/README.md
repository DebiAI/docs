## Bias detection

[The data distribution](./data_distribution/) will help you detect classes of samples that needs to be more represented in your dataset to avoid biased results.

## Outlier detection

[The parrallel coordinates](./parallel_coordinates/). If data is missing, is inconsistent, or is not in a proper format, the widget will help you quickly find the problem.

[The point plot](./point_plot/) widget can also show the samples that have an abnormal behaviour, for example with spatial repartition.

## Model evaluation

[The point plot](./point_plot/) widget can clearly display the models performances according to a project context of your choice.

## Data selection

[The parrallel coordinates](./parallel_coordinates/) widget, because it shows numerous columns, makes it very effective for selecting data..

[The point plot](./point_plot/) widget, like many other widgets, can also select data according to their 2D position.
