# Getting started

After installing DebiAI: [Installation guide](../gettingStarted/installation/README.md),

you will need to create a project and add data to your DebiAI instance: [Inserting data](dataInsertion/README.md).

You can start analysing your data with the DebiAI dashboard : [Analysing data](../../dashboard/introduction.md).
