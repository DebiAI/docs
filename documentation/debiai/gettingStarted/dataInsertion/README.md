# Inserting data

Being a data visualisation application, providing the project data to DebiAI is a requiered step.

The data

**Limitations :**
- Samples size

## Python module
The main way to add provide the project data to the application is to use the DebiAI Python module.
The module was made to be used directly in your Python workflow, to add the model results directly after a model evaluation per example.


## Project data providers (comming soon)

The data providers will allow your project to expose its data trough a REST API.
DebiAI will directly ask for the data from your project making the data loading process very quick and customisable, the provided data won't have to be duplicated in the DebiAI application.
